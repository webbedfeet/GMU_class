### Biotechnology, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence: Promises, Dangers, Worries, Gotchas

__Abstract:__ This presentation provides an overview of how Big Data and Artificial Intelligence
can play a role in the advancement of biotechnology both from a scientific and a business
perspective. Though the promise of Big Data and AI is huge, it is also a path
filled with peril, if the practitioner is not aware or careful. Several cautionary 
situations are presented where it is evident that Big Data + AI is not the panacea
for all situtations, and in fact, these issues are increasingly being highlighted in
the scientific and genral media.
